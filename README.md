# parse-MCNP-ascii-ptrac-file-via-Mathematica

# After generating a ptrac file from MCNP [1] this is an attempt to plot out some tracks. This notebook is a proof of concept that plotting of particle tracks inside a Mathematica is accomplished at first via hard coding data then developed a methodology for extracting out the necessary data from an ascii ptrac file.
